# Robot Soccer Strategy - Autonomous Movement
 
This project implements an autonomous strategy for controlling a team of friendly robots in a simulated soccer environment. The robots execute coordinated movements based on the ball's position and predefined game logic.

Features
Team Formation: Robots position themselves strategically based on predefined coordinates.
Scoring Mechanism: The primary robot moves towards the ball, dribbles, and attempts to score when in range.
Dynamic Decision-Making: The robots adjust their actions based on the ball's location and their current positioning.
Run Around Mode: If the ball is out of the play zone, specific robots move to a designated position while others hold their positions.
Code Overview
Game Class:
The run() function determines whether the robots should engage in team play, attempt to score, or move around.
team() Function:
Positions robots based on predefined locations when in a team formation.
runAround() Function:
Moves select robots to a specific location while maintaining the positions of others.
score() Function:
Controls the primary robot's movement to position itself correctly for scoring.
Engages the dribbler and executes a shot based on proximity to the ball.
Requirements
Dependencies: Uses base/vector, base/world, and stp_vibes/skills/moveto modules.
Environment: Designed to run in a simulated soccer environment with friendly robot agents.
Usage
Initialize the environment with the required modules.
Instantiate the Game class.
Call the run() method to execute the strategy.
This code provides a solid foundation for autonomous robotic soccer strategy and can be expanded with more complex behaviors and optimizations.
